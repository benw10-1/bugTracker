## Description

This full stack application allows for user sign up and login functionality in order to use it. Users must sign up first and then log in in order to add projects to their dashboard. After a user signs up, an email verification is sent to their email for them to verify. Then, the user can login and add projects. After a project is created, users and contributors can add bugs or issues to the project so that the members of the project can view these tickets to make necessary changes. The bugs can be deleted after the issue is resolved and it can be updated by users. Project owners can also add contributors to the project so that they can add bugs as well.
